Derived classes are used for augmenting the functionality of base class by 
adding or modifying the properties and methods to suit the requirements of 
the specialization necessary for derived class. 
This allows for defining virtual methods that form the means to implement polymorphism, 
which allows a group of objects to work in uniform manner.
 Thus, the inherent advantages of inheritance and polymorphism like 
code reuse, faster development, easy maintenance, etc., are realized.


can virtual functions be private ? Yes,they can.

How to seal a class, that is how can we ensure that it DOES not gets inherited?
Solution: just declare the class as final. this will ensure that this class will never get inherited.
class A final  //note final keyword is used after the class name
{
   //...
};

class B : public A  //error - because class A is marked final (sealed).
{                   //        so A cannot be derived from.
   //...
};








can we call a method inside a class with \out creating an object out of it?
Sol : Yes, by declaring the method as static.



override keyword ?

There is a method with the same name in the parent class.
The method in the parent class is declared as “virtual” which means it was intended to be rewritten.
The method in the parent class has the same signature as the method in the subclass.

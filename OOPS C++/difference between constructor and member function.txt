 constructor is different from normal functions in following ways:

1)Constructor has same name as the class itself
2)Constructors donâ€™t have return type
3)A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
4)If we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates a default constructor for us (expects no parameters and has an empty body).

//also, sometimes we might need different constructors to implement our class to allow omitting some of the paramaters that we set up already.

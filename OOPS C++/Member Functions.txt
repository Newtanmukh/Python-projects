5 types of functions :

1)simple member functions.

2)static member functions : these functions can be called directly from the class, without even the need of creating the object !\
this can only access the static data members as well as the static member functions.
Example : 	
		class X
			{
 		   public:
  		  static void f()
  		  {
   		     // statement
   		 }
		};

		int main()
		{
  		  X::f();   // calling member function directly with class name
		}

3)const : void function() const 
		{
		}
	const keyword makes variables constant, such functions can never modify the object or its related data members

this following code block will give error :

	int Demo::get_data() const
	{
  	  x=x+1;
   	 return x;
	}


4) inline functions : the ones defined inside

5) friend functions  :give access to private amd protected members by non-class functions.
			we can even define a member function of other class as a friend.

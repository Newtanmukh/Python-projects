Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about 
the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.

abstraction can be achieved using :


1)classes :  Class helps us to group data members and member functions using 
available ACCESS SPECIFIERS.
 A Class can decide which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.
Say, the members that defines the internal implementation can be marked as private in a class.
And the important information needed to be given to the outside world can be marked as public.

2)header files : For example, consider the pow() method present in math.h header file.
 Whenever we need to calculate power of a number,
 we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file 
and pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying 
algorithm according to which the function is actually calculating power of numbers.

Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them. 

Here the data of sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”. 


Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding. 
As using encapsulation also hides the data.
In the above example the data of any of the section like sales, 
finance or accounts is hidden from any other section.
